            After struggling for 7 years, the team finally moved towards the right direction. They signed LeBron James in 2018, which was a good start. In 2019, Lakers sent away their young players to get Anthony Davis and built a new team around the two superstars.

          <p>
            Most of the new players in the team were players with proven track records. However, there were also dispute and doubt. In the ESPN prediction, Lakers was ranked only 4th towards the champion,  with >50% the experts believing that LeBron would get 0 title in the next 4 years.
